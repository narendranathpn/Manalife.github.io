      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <!-- Mission -->
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        At Manalife AI, our mission is to transform maternity and women’s
        healthcare through intelligent and accessible technology. We empower
        gynaecologists, healthcare providers, and expectant mothers with
        AI-driven insights that support early detection, personalized care,
        and improved clinical outcomes. A key focus of our work is enabling
        early screening and intervention for cervical cancer, addressing a
        critical gap in preventive care—especially in underserved regions.
      </p>

      <!-- Team -->
      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p>
        The Manalife founding team brings over 100+ years of combined
        experience across technology, healthcare operations, gynaecology, and
        oncology. This diverse expertise allows us to build solutions that
        are both clinically grounded and technologically advanced. We are
        supported by a global panel of advisors in medicine, medical
        technology, and regulatory strategy, ensuring our work remains
        relevant, evidence-based, and globally compliant.
      </p>

      <!-- Geographies -->
      <h3>Geographies</h3>
      <p>
        We are currently serving gynaecologists and expectant mothers in
        <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Malaysia</strong>, two regions with
        diverse healthcare landscapes and growing demand for digital innovation
        in maternal care. In India, we focus on bridging gaps in both urban and
        rural settings, where access to timely diagnostics and personalized
        care remains a challenge. In Malaysia, we collaborate with clinics and
        health systems to support national efforts in digital health
        transformation, including the shift from paper-based maternity records
        to intelligent, AI-powered platforms. Our goal is to expand thoughtfully,
        building on local insights while delivering globally scalable solutions.

      <!-- Manalife Core -->
      <h3>Manalife Core</h3>
      <p>
        Manalife Core is the foundation of our digital maternity care
        platform, built to streamline and elevate the daily workflows of
        gynaecologists, clinics, and hospitals. It features a gynaecology-specific
        Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system inspired from Redbook, along
        with tools for appointment scheduling, video consultations, and integration
        with home-based diagnostic devices. The platform also includes a companion
        app for expectant mothers, enabling them to journal their daily experiences,
        complete check-ins with their doctors, and access curated educational content.
        Designed with a strong emphasis on usability and clinical relevance,
        Manalife Core empowers care providers to deliver more efficient, connected,
        and personalized maternity care.
      </p>       

      <!-- Manalife AI -->
      <h3>Manalife AI</h3>
      <p>
        Manalife AI is the intelligence layer of the platform, designed to
        support clinical decision-making and improve maternal health outcomes
        through data-driven insights. It leverages machine learning models to
        analyze patient data, identify potential risks, and generate timely alerts
        for gynaecologists. Key applications include predictive monitoring during
        antenatal care, automated triaging, and personalized care pathways.
        Built with explainability and clinician trust in mind, Manalife AI transforms
        routine care into proactive, precision-driven healthcare.
      </p>

      <!-- Clinical Decision Support -->
      <h3>Clinical Decision Support for Gynaecologists</h3>
      <p>
        Manalife AI provides gynaecologists with real-time, context-aware decision
        support that enhances clinical accuracy and response time. By continuously
        analyzing patient data—including vitals, symptoms, lab results, and scan
        reports—the system flags emerging risks such as preeclampsia, gestational
        diabetes, and fetal growth anomalies. Clinicians receive evidence-backed
        recommendations that are integrated into their workflow, ensuring timely
        and informed interventions without added cognitive load.
      </p>

      <!-- Cervical Cancer Detection -->
      <h3>Cervical Cancer Detection</h3>
      <p>
        A flagship capability of Manalife AI is its AI-powered cervical cancer
        screening tool, which assists clinicians in early detection of pre-cancerous
        and cancerous lesions from colposcopy or cytology images. The system leverages
        advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms to highlight suspicious
        regions and assign risk levels. Designed to augment clinical judgment, this
        tool improves diagnostic accuracy and enables timely referrals and treatment,
        especially in low-resource settings where specialist availability may be limited.
